**Color:** Soft Violet (#8A6BBE)

**Tagline:** Hopeful Idealist | Impractical Visionary

---

### Overview

The Dreamer archetype embodies the spirit of idealism, creativity, and heartfelt optimism. Dreamers live in the realm of possibilities — constantly imagining a world that could be better, kinder, and more beautiful. Their visions are fueled less by cold logic and more by values, emotions, and a deep desire for meaning.

Unlike the pragmatic doers or controlling Visionaries, Dreamers are poetic, sensitive, and often rebellious against the status quo because it feels unjust or uninspired. They inspire others through their boundless hope and passion for change but can also struggle to translate dreams into concrete reality.
