## Overview

The Realist is the pragmatic anchor in any situation, the steady hand that sees things as they truly are, not as they wish them to be. They excel in dealing with the here and now, basing decisions on facts, experience, and a clear-eyed assessment of resources and constraints.

Unlike idealists who focus on possibilities or visionaries who dream big, Realists ground themselves in what’s achievable and useful. They are the master navigators of everyday life and complex systems alike, balancing cautious judgment with practical action.

While they may sometimes be mistaken for pessimists or skeptics, Realists are essential to any group or project—they prevent wasted effort, manage risk, and bring balance to overly ambitious plans. Their worldview prioritizes efficiency, reliability, and tangible results.
